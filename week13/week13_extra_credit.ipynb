It analyzed variables like uninsured rates and populations that are helpful planning factors. Though it fell short in directly linking specific open datasets, ChatGPT named useful sources that I can search myself. While not solving the entire data challenge, ChatGPT moved my project forward by identifying key indicators to study and governmental portals to mine further. With these constructive building blocks from ChatGPT, I can continue developing my growth strategy and locate the precise data assets to model city-specific expansion.\n"
