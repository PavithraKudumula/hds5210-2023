# Week 2 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.


## Final Score: 9/10

## Multiple Choice:
_Did you complete and submit the multiple choice part of the assignment?_
* **All good.**

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* **Everything worked as expected**

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
  * **Good.**
  * 
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
  * **Careful in 5.5. You have 2 separate `return` statements. That doesn't make sense.**
  * **(-1) In 5.6, you used "hard coded" values instead of the variables that you created. Make sure you're using variables in a way that helps your code be easier to read and more flexible.**
