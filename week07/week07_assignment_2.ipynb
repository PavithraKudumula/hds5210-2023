In this week's assignment, you will need to create your own JSON document to store information about yourself and the grades you've received from week 1 to week 4 and the week 6 quiz.  That is, everything you should have received a grade for.  Then you'll need to show me you know how to navigate the JSON in that file.\n",

The \"Assignment grade\" key contains a nested list of dictionaries, one for each week's assignment grade, with keys for \"week,\" \"grade,\" and \"comment.\" This hierarchy allows for easy access to different sections of the biography while keeping related data together, making it easy to maintain and expand the data structure as needed.\n"

Instructions on the expected JSON format and data to be extracted were provided in detail. The easiest part was using the available data to build the JSON data structure. Accessing and printing the assignment details in English using loops was the more difficult part. Parsing nested dictionaries and lists was a significant part of this challenge, thus it was well worth taking on. In general, I appreciated the assignment's emphasis on putting JSON and Python's ability to manipulate structured data to good use. If anyone wants to improve their data processing and Python abilities, this is a fantastic exercise to do."
